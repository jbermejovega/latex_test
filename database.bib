  abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are becoming increasingly popular for training Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) due to their ability to conserve quantum resources. However, there is currently a lack of user-friendly tools for implementing this approach. To address this issue, this paper proposes EVOVAQ, a Python-based framework designed to simplify the use of EAs for training VQCs. EVOVAQ seamlessly integrates evolutionary computation with quantum libraries such as Qiskit, making it easy to use for both quantum computing and EAs communities. Furthermore, EVOVAQ’s scalability enables the development of customized solutions, promoting innovation in the quantum computing field.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamics is built with the concept of equilibrium states. However, it is less clear how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges through the dynamics that follows the principle of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we develop a theory of quantum thermodynamics that is applicable for arbitrary small systems, even for single particle systems coupled with a reservoir. We generalize the concept of temperature beyond equilibrium that depends on the detailed dynamics of quantum states. We apply the theory to a cavity system and a two-level system interacting with a reservoir, respectively. The results unravels (1) the emergence of thermodynamics naturally from the exact quantum dynamics in the weak system-reservoir coupling regime without introducing the hypothesis of equilibrium between the system and the reservoir from the beginning; (2) the emergence of thermodynamics in the intermediate system-reservoir coupling regime where the Born-Markovian approximation is broken down; (3) the breakdown of thermodynamics due to the long-time non-Markovian memory effect arisen from the occurrence of localized bound states; (4) the existence of dynamical quantum phase transition characterized by inflationary dynamics associated with negative dynamical temperature. The corresponding dynamical criticality provides a border separating classical and quantum worlds. The inflationary dynamics may also relate to the origin of big bang and universe inflation. And the third law of thermodynamics, allocated in the deep quantum realm, is naturally proved.},

If the statistical uncertainty in the data dominates over other experimental errors, then a tomographic reconstruction procedure must express this uncertainty. A rigorous way to accomplish this is via statistical confidence regions (CRs) in state space. Naturally, the size of this region decreases when increasing the number of samples, but it also depends critically on the construction method of the region. We compare recent methods for constructing CRs as well as a reference method based on a Gaussian approximation. For the comparison, we propose an operational measure with the finding, that there is a significant difference between methods, but which method is preferable can depend on the details of the state preparation scenario.},

Formally, this is equivalent to solving the master equation. For an N-dimensional Hilbert space it requires (i) solving a first order N 2×N 2 matrix time evolution (to obtain the completely positive map), and (ii) diagonalizing a related N 2×N 2 matrix (to obtain a Kraus-type representation). Conversely, for a given time-dependent linear map, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for the existence of a corresponding master equation, where the (not necessarily unique) form of this equation is explicitly determined. It is shown that a “best possible” master equation may always be defined, for approximating the evolution in the case that no exact master equation exists. Examples involving qubits are given.},

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

For the case of a single qubit, we show that a single nonunitary process is necessary and sufficient to generate all unital Markovian quantum dynamics, whereas a set of processes parametrized by one continuous parameter is needed in general.

  abstract = {Quantum state discrimination underlies various applications in quantum information processing tasks. It essentially describes the distinguishability of quantum systems in different states, and the general process of extracting classical information from quantum systems. It is also useful in quantum information applications, such as the characterization of mutual information in cryptographic protocols, or as a technique for deriving fundamental theorems on quantum foundations. It has deep connections to physical principles such as relativistic causality. Quantum state discrimination traces a long history of several decades, starting with the early attempts to formalize information processing of physical systems such as optical communication with photons. Nevertheless, in most cases, the problems of finding optimal strategies of quantum state discrimination remain unsolved, and related applications are valid in some limited cases only. The present review aims to provide an overview on quantum state discrimination, covering some recent progress, and addressing applications in some selected areas. This review serves to strengthen the link between results in quantum state discrimination and quantum information applications, by showing the ways in which the fundamental results are exploited in applications and vice versa.},

Realistic quantum systems are often affected by dissipation and decoherence due to coupling to an external environment. This raises the question whether the steady states of such open quantum systems contain sufficient information allowing for full and efficient reconstruction of the system’s dynamics. We find that such a reconstruction is possible for generic local Markovian dynamics. We propose a recovery method that uses only local measurements; for systems with finite-range interactions, the method recovers the Lindbladian acting on each spatial domain using only observables within that domain. We numerically study the accuracy of the reconstruction as a function of the number of measurements, type of open-system dynamics and system size. Interestingly, we show that couplings to external environments can in fact facilitate the reconstruction of Hamiltonians composed of commuting terms.},

In quantum mechanics, it is possible to eliminate degrees of freedom from a system by leveraging symmetry to identify the possible physical transitions.

In our present work, we develop alternative symmetry testing quantum algorithms that are efficiently implementable on quantum computers. Our approach estimates asymmetry measures based on the Hilbert--Schmidt distance, which is significantly easier, in a computational sense, than using fidelity as a metric. The method is derived to measure symmetries of states, channels, Lindbladians, and measurements. We apply this method to a number of scenarios involving open quantum systems, including the amplitude damping channel and a spin chain, and we test for symmetries within and outside the finite symmetry group of the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators.},

  abstract = {We show that a set of gates that consists of all one-bit quantum gates [U(2)] and the two-bit exclusive-OR gate [that maps Boolean values (x,y) to (x,x⊕y)] is universal in the sense that all unitary operations on arbitrarily many bits n [U(2n)] can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2) transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical and of all remaining input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety of two- and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for arbitrary n-bit unitary operations., This article appears in the following collection:},

Systems in the equilibrium states of these processes serve as batteries, storing energy. The dissipative process that brings the battery to the active equilibrium state is driven by an agent that couples the battery to thermal systems. The second law of thermodynamics imposes a work cost for the process; however, no work is needed to keep the battery in that charged state. We consider simple examples of these batteries and discuss situations in which the charged state has full population inversion, in which case the extractable work is maximal, and circumstances in which the efficiency of the process is maximal.},

With a generalized Lieb-Robinson bound, we show that the evolution in this very generic framework is quasi-local, i.e., the evolution of observables can be approximated by implementing the dynamics only in a vicinity of the observables' support. The precision increases exponentially with the diameter of the considered subsystem. Hence, the time-evolution can be simulated on classical computers with a cost that is independent of the system size. Providing error bounds for Trotter decompositions, we conclude that the simulation on a quantum computer is additionally efficient in time. For experiments and simulations, our result can be used to rigorously bound finite-size effects.},

Our method is based on incorporating the knowledge of the reduced steady state into its dynamics. The correction not only steers the reduced system toward a correct steady state but also improves the accuracy of the dynamics, thereby refining the archetypal Born-Markov weak-coupling second-order master equations. In case of equilibrium, we use the exact mean-force Gibbs state to correct the Redfield quantum master equation. By benchmarking it with the exact solution of the damped harmonic oscillator, we show that our method also helps correct the long-standing issue of positivity violation, albeit without complete positivity. Our method of a canonically consistent quantum master equation opens a new perspective in the theory of open quantum systems leading to a reduced density matrix accurate beyond the commonly used Redfield and Lindblad equations, while retaining the same conceptual and numerical complexity.},

The techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4, 5].},

While the experimental advancement toward realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed. A comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices is additionally provided.},

With increasing system correlations and size, numerical methods fell rather inefficient, and there was a need to simulate quantum mechanical phenomena on actual quantum computing hardware. Now, with noisy quantum computing machines that have been built and made available to use, realising quantum simulations are edging towards a practical reality. In this paper, we talk about the progress that has been made in the field of quantum simulations by actual quantum computing hardware and talk about some very fascinating fields where it has expanded its branches, too.

The predominant state estimation procedure, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), generally reports an estimate with zero eigenvalues. These cannot be justified. Furthermore, the MLE estimate is incompatible with error bars, so conclusions drawn from it are suspect. I propose an alternative procedure, Bayesian mean estimation (BME). BME never yields zero eigenvalues, its eigenvalues provide a bound on their own uncertainties, and under certain circumstances it is provably the most accurate procedure possible. I show how to implement BME numerically, and how to obtain natural error bars that are compatible with the estimate. Finally, I briefly discuss the differences between Bayesian and frequentist estimation techniques.},

The key to this simplification is the incorporation of prior knowledge of the class of physical interactions involved in generating the dynamics, which reduces the problem to one of parameter estimation. This allows part of the problem to be tackled using efficient convex methods, which, when coupled with a constraint on some parameters, allows globally optimal estimates for the Krauss operators to be determined from experimental data. Parameterizing the maps provides further advantages: it allows the incorporation of mixed states of the environment as well as some initial correlation between the system and environment, both of which are common physical situations following excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of positive maps for the dynamical evolution of a quantum system at all times.},

Projective simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is different from other, computational, notions of simulation and it provides a new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning and quantum computation.},

Our main finding is that fluctuations in qubit relaxation are local to the qubit and are caused by instabilities of near-resonant two-level-systems (TLS). Through statistical analysis, we determine sub-millihertz switching rates of these TLS and observe the coherent coupling between an individual TLS and a transmon qubit. Finally, we find evidence that the qubit’s frequency stability produces a 0.8 ms limit on the pure dephasing which we also observe. These findings raise the need for performing qubit metrology to examine the reproducibility of qubit parameters, where these fluctuations could affect qubit gate fidelity.},

We propose an algorithm to simulate circuits with encoded Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, specifically for odd-dimensional encoded qudits. Our approach is tailored to be especially effective in the most challenging but practically relevant regime, where the codeword states exhibit high (but finite) squeezing. Our algorithm leverages the Zak-Gross Wigner function introduced by J. Davis et al. [arXiv:2407.18394], which represents infinitely squeezed encoded stabilizer states positively. The runtime of the algorithm scales with the amount of negativity of this Wigner function, enabling fast simulation of certain large-scale circuits with a high degree of squeezing.},

  abstract = {Many standard linear algebra problems can be solved on a quantum computer by using recently developed quantum linear algebra algorithms that make use of block encodings and quantum eigenvalue/singular value transformations. A block encoding embeds a properly scaled matrix of interest A in a larger unitary transformation U that can be decomposed into a product of simpler unitaries and implemented efficiently on a quantum computer. Although quantum algorithms can potentially achieve exponential speedup in solving linear algebra problems compared to the best classical algorithm, such gain in efficiency ultimately hinges on our ability to construct an efficient quantum circuit for the block encoding of A, which is difficult in general, and not trivial even for well-structured sparse matrices. In this paper, we give a few examples on how efficient quantum circuits can be explicitly constructed for some well-structured sparse matrices, and discuss a few strategies used in these constructions.

Here, we depart from such idealizations and investigate, in both theory and experiment, the detection of genuine multipartite entanglement when measurements are subject to small imperfections. For arbitrary qubits number 𝑛, we construct multipartite entanglement witnesses where the detrimental influence of the imperfection is independent of 𝑛. In a tabletop four-partite photonic experiment, we demonstrate first how a small amount of alignment error can undermine the conclusions drawn from standard entanglement witnesses and then perform the correction analysis. Furthermore, since we consider quantum devices that are trusted but not perfectly controlled, we showcase advantages in terms of noise resilience as compared to device-independent models.},

  abstract = {Practical challenges in simulating quantum systems on classical computers have been widely recognized in the quantum physics and quantum chemistry communities over the past century. Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This Review provides an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {Large dynamical fluctuations—atypical realizations of the dynamics sustained over long periods of time—can play a fundamental role in determining the properties of collective behavior of both classical and quantum nonequilibrium systems. Rare dynamical fluctuations, however, occur with a probability that often decays exponentially in their time extent, thus making them difficult to be directly observed and exploited in experiments. Here, using methods from dynamical large deviations, we explain how rare dynamics of a given (Markovian) open quantum system can always be obtained from the typical realizations of an alternative (also Markovian) system. The correspondence between these two sets of realizations can be used to engineer and control open quantum systems with a desired statistics “on demand.” We illustrate these ideas by studying the photon emission behavior of a three-qubit system which displays a sharp dynamical crossover between active and inactive dynamical phases.},

In particular, artificial neural networks have been successfully used to mitigate the exponential complexity often encountered in quantum many-body physics, the study of properties of quantum systems built from a large number of interacting particles. In this article, we review some applications of neural networks in condensed matter physics and quantum information, with particular emphasis on hands-on tutorials serving as a quick start for a newcomer to the field. The prerequisites of this tutorial are basic probability theory and calculus, linear algebra, basic notions of neural networks, statistical physics, and quantum mechanics. The reader is introduced to supervised machine learning with convolutional neural networks to learn a phase transition, unsupervised learning with restricted Boltzmann machines to perform quantum tomography, and the variational Monte Carlo method with recurrent neural networks for approximating the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian. For each algorithm, we briefly review the key ingredients and their corresponding neural-network implementation, and show numerical experiments for a system of interacting Rydberg atoms in two dimensions.},

The specific task we consider is to simultaneously learn all the eigenvalues of an 𝑛-qubit Pauli channel to ±ɛ precision. We give an estimation protocol with an 𝑛-qubit ancilla that succeeds with high probability using only 𝑂⁢(𝑛/ɛ2) copies of the Pauli channel, while proving that any ancilla-free protocol (possibly with adaptive control and channel concatenation) would need at least Ω⁡(2𝑛/3) rounds of measurement. We further study the advantages provided by a small number of ancillas. For the case that a 𝑘-qubit ancilla (𝑘≤𝑛) is available, we obtain a sample complexity lower bound of Ω⁡(2(𝑛−𝑘)/3) for any nonconcatenating protocol, and a stronger lower bound of Ω⁡(𝑛⁢2𝑛−𝑘) for any nonadaptive, nonconcatenating protocol, which is shown to be tight. We also show how to apply the ancilla-assisted estimation protocol to a practical quantum benchmarking task in a noise-resilient and sample-efficient manner, given reasonable noise assumptions. Our results provide a practically interesting example for quantum advantages in learning and also bring insights for quantum benchmarking.},

Using these mechanisms of dephasing-assisted transport (DAT) in a hybrid basis of both excitons and sites, we develop a detailed picture of how noise enables energy transfer with efficiencies well above 90\% across the Fenna–Matthew–Olson (FMO) complex, a type of light-harvesting molecule. We demonstrate explicitly how noise alters the pathways of energy transfer across the complex, suppressing ineffective pathways and facilitating direct ones to the reaction centre. We explain that the fundamental mechanisms underpinning DAT are expected to be robust with respect to the considered noise model but show that the specific details of the exciton–phonon coupling, which remain largely unknown in these type of complexes, and in particular the impact of non-Markovian effects, result in variations of dynamical features that should be amenable to experimental verification with current or planned technology. A detailed understanding of DAT in natural compounds could open up a new paradigm of ‘noise-engineering’ by which EET can be optimized in artificial light-harvesting structures.},

In the problem of PAC learning quantum process, we want to learn an \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-approximate of an unknown quantum process \$c\textasciicircum *\$ from a known finite concept class \$C\$ with probability \$1-\textbackslash delta\$ using samples \$\textbackslash\{(x\_1,c\textasciicircum *(x\_1)),(x\_2,c\textasciicircum *(x\_2)),\textbackslash dots\textbackslash\}\$, where \$\textbackslash\{x\_1,x\_2, \textbackslash dots\textbackslash\}\$ are computational basis states sampled from an unknown distribution \$D\$ and \$\textbackslash\{c\textasciicircum *(x\_1),c\textasciicircum *(x\_2),\textbackslash dots\textbackslash\}\$ are the (possibly mixed) quantum states outputted by \$c\textasciicircum *\$. The special case of PAC-learning quantum process under constant input reduces to a natural problem which we named as approximate state discrimination, where we are given copies of an unknown quantum state \$c\textasciicircum *\$ from an known finite set \$C\$, and we want to learn with probability \$1-\textbackslash delta\$ an \$\textbackslash epsilon\$-approximate of \$c\textasciicircum *\$ with as few copies of \$c\textasciicircum *\$ as possible. We show that the problem of PAC learning quantum process can be solved with \$\$O\textbackslash left(\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash log|C| + \textbackslash log(1/ \textbackslash delta)\} \{ \textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2\}\textbackslash right)\$\$ samples when the outputs are pure states and \$\$O\textbackslash left(\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash log\textasciicircum 3 |C|(\textbackslash log |C|+\textbackslash log(1/ \textbackslash delta))\} \{ \textbackslash epsilon\textasciicircum 2\}\textbackslash right)\$\$ samples if the outputs can be mixed. Some implications of our results are that we can PAC-learn a polynomial sized quantum circuit in polynomial samples and approximate state discrimination can be solved in polynomial samples even when concept class size \$|C|\$ is exponential in the number of qubits, an exponentially improvement over a full state tomography.},

In general, the optimal measurement for distinguishing such states is a collective measurement. However, to the best our knowledge, collective measurements have not been used to enhance quantum state discrimination to date. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in the usual state discrimination setting with equal prior probabilities, at least three copies of a quantum state are required to be measured collectively to outperform separable measurements. This is very challenging experimentally. In this work, by considering unequal prior probabilities, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for distinguishing two copies of single qubit states using collective measurements which achieves a lower probability of error than can be achieved by any non-entangling measurement. Additionally, we implemented collective measurements on three and four copies of the unknown state and found they performed poorly.},

Researchers in this field are stimulated and inspired by the outstanding progress of molecular biology that has begun to reveal the secrets of the natural nanomachines which constitute the material base of life. Like their macroscopic counterparts, nanoscale machines need energy to operate. Most molecular motors of the biological world are fueled by chemical reactions, but research in the last fifteen years has demonstrated that light energy can be used to power nanomachines by exploiting photochemical processes in appropriately designed artificial systems. As a matter of fact, light excitation exhibits several advantages with regard to the operation of the machine, and can also be used to monitor its state through spectroscopic methods. In this review we will illustrate the design principles at the basis of photochemically driven molecular machines, and we will describe a few examples based on rotaxane-type structures investigated in our laboratories.},

  abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence is a research topic whose relevance has increased in recent years, especially with the advent of large machine learning models. However, very few attempts have been proposed to improve interpretability in the case of quantum artificial intelligence, and many existing quantum machine learning models in the literature can be considered almost as black boxes. In this article, we argue that an appropriate semantic interpretation of a given quantum circuit that solves a problem can be of interest to the user not only to certify the correct behavior of the learned model, but also to obtain a deeper insight into the problem at hand and its solution. We focus on decision-making problems that can be formulated as classification tasks and propose a method for learning quantum rule-based systems to solve them using evolutionary optimization algorithms. The approach is tested to learn rules that solve control and decision-making tasks in reinforcement learning environments, to provide interpretable agent policies that help to understand the internal dynamics of an unknown environment. Our results conclude that the learned policies are not only highly explainable, but can also help detect non-relevant features of problems and produce a minimal set of rules.},

  abstract = {Quantum Machine Learning was born during the past decade as the intersection of Quantum Computing and Machine Learning. Today, advances in quantum computer hardware and the design of simulation frameworks able to run quantum algorithms in classic computers make it possible to extend classic artificial intelligence models to a quantum environment. Despite these achievements, several questions regarding the whole quantum machine learning pipeline remain unanswered, for instance the problem of classical data representation on quantum hardware, or the methodologies for designing and evaluating quantum models for common learning tasks such as classification, function approximation, clustering, etc. These problems become even more difficult to solve in the case of Time Series processing, where the context of past historical data may influence the behavior of the decision-making model. In this piece of research, we address the problem of Time Series classification using quantum models, and propose an efficient and compact representation of time series in quantum data using amplitude embedding. The proposal is capable of representing a time series of length n in \$\$log\_2(n)\$\$computational units, and experiments conducted on benchmark time series classification problems show that quantum models designed for classification can also outperform the accuracy of classic methods.},

Existing approaches vary in the information obtained as well as the amount of quantum and classical resources required, with more information generally requiring more resources. Here we benchmark the characterization methods of gate set tomography, Pauli channel noise reconstruction, and empirical direct characterization for developing models that describe noisy quantum circuit performance on a 27-qubit superconducting transmon device. We evaluate these models by comparing the accuracy of noisy circuit simulations with the corresponding experimental observations. We find that the agreement of noise model to experiment does not correlate with the information gained by characterization and that the underlying circuit strongly influences the best choice of characterization approach. Empirical direct characterization scales best of the methods we tested and produced the most accurate characterizations across our benchmarks.},

  abstract = {The development of quantum computing across several technologies and platforms has reached the point of having an advantage over classical computers for an artificial problem, a point known as ‘quantum advantage’. As a next step along the development of this technology, it is now important to discuss ‘practical quantum advantage’, the point at which quantum devices will solve problems of practical interest that are not tractable for traditional supercomputers. Many of the most promising short-term applications of quantum computers fall under the umbrella of quantum simulation: modelling the quantum properties of microscopic particles that are directly relevant to modern materials science, high-energy physics and quantum chemistry. This would impact several important real-world applications, such as developing materials for batteries, industrial catalysis or nitrogen fixing. Much as aerodynamics can be studied either through simulations on a digital computer or in a wind tunnel, quantum simulation can be performed not only on future fault-tolerant digital quantum computers but also already today through special-purpose analogue quantum simulators. Here we overview the state of the art and future perspectives for quantum simulation, arguing that a first practical quantum advantage already exists in the case of specialized applications of analogue devices, and that fully digital devices open a full range of applications but require further development of fault-tolerant hardware. Hybrid digital–analogue devices that exist today already promise substantial flexibility in near-term applications.},

  abstract = {Quantum tomography is the main method used to assess the quality of quantum information processing devices. However, the amount of resources needed for quantum tomography is exponential in the device size. Part of the problem is that tomography generates much more information than is usually sought. Taking a more targeted approach, we develop schemes that enable (i) estimating the fidelity of an experiment to a theoretical ideal description, (ii) learning which description within a reduced subset best matches the experimental data. Both these approaches yield a significant reduction in resources compared to tomography. In particular, we demonstrate that fidelity can be estimated from a number of simple experiments that is independent of the system size, removing an important roadblock for the experimental study of larger quantum information processing units.},

  abstract = {Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {Noise can be considered the natural enemy of quantum information. An often implied benefit of high-dimensional entanglement is its increased resilience to noise. However, manifesting this potential in an experimentally meaningful fashion is challenging and has never been done before. In infinite dimensional spaces, discretization is inevitable and renders the effective dimension of quantum states a tunable parameter. Owing to advances in experimental techniques and theoretical tools, we demonstrate an increased resistance to noise by identifying two pathways to exploit high-dimensional entangled states. Our study is based on two separate experiments utilizing canonical spatiotemporal properties of entangled photon pairs. Following these different pathways to noise resilience, we are able to certify entanglement in the photonic orbital-angular-momentum and energy-time degrees of freedom up to noise conditions corresponding to a noise fraction of 72\% and 92\%, respectively. Our work paves the way toward practical quantum communication systems that are able to surpass current noise and distance limitations, while not compromising on potential device independence.},

This paper addresses CF in the challenging context of Online Continual Learning (OCL), with tasks presented as a continuous data stream with unknown boundaries. We extend OCL for ASR into the unsupervised realm, by leveraging self-training (ST) to facilitate unsupervised adaptation, enabling models to adapt continually without label dependency and without forgetting previous knowledge. Through comparative analysis of various OCL and ST methods across two domain adaptation experiments, we show that UOCL suffers from significantly less forgetting compared to supervised OCL, allowing UOCL methods to approach the performance levels of supervised OCL. Our proposed UOCL extensions further boosts UOCL's efficacy. Our findings represent a significant step towards continually adaptable ASR systems, capable of leveraging unlabeled data across diverse domains.},

A substantial obstacle to this is the extreme fragility of quantum systems to “decoherence” from environmental noise and other control limitations. Although quantum computation is possible if the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain conditions, existing methods for noise characterization are intractable for present multibody systems. We introduce a technique based on symmetrization that enables direct experimental measurement of some key properties of the decoherence affecting a quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. The technique is demonstrated for the optimization of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.},

  abstract = {In 2017, John Preskill defined Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as an intermediate step on the road to large scale error corrected fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC). The NISQ regime corresponds to noisy qubit quantum computers with the potential to solve actual problems of some commercial value faster than conventional supercomputers, or consuming less energy. Over five years on, it is a good time to review the situation. While rapid progress is being made with quantum hardware and algorithms, and many recent experimental demonstrations, no one has yet successfully implemented a use case matching the original definition of the NISQ regime. This paper investigates the space, fidelity and time resources of various NISQ algorithms and highlights several contradictions between NISQ requirements and actual as well as future quantum hardware capabilities. It then covers various techniques which could help like qubit fidelities improvements, various breeds of quantum error mitigation methods, analog/digital hybridization, using specific qubit types like multimode photons as well as quantum annealers and analog quantum computers (aka quantum simulators or programmable Hamiltonian simulators) which seem closer to delivering useful applications although they have their own mid to longer-term scalability challenges. Given all the constraints of these various solutions, it seems possible to expect some practical use cases for NISQ systems, but with a very narrow window before various scaling issues show up. Turning to the future, a scenario can be envisioned where NISQ will not necessarily be an intermediate step on the road to FTQC. Instead, the two may develop along different paths, due to their different requirements. This leaves open a key question on the trade-offs that may be necessary to make between qubit scale and qubit fidelities in future quantum computers designs.},

  abstract = {Operating quantum sensors and quantum computers would make data in the form of quantum states available for purely quantum processing, opening new avenues for studying physical processes and certifying quantum technologies. In this Perspective, we review a line of works dealing with measurements that reveal structural properties of quantum datasets given in the form of product states. These algorithms are universal, meaning that their performances do not depend on the reference frame in which the dataset is provided. Requiring the universality property implies a characterization of optimal measurements via group representation theory.},

A larger hardware-native gate set may decrease the number of required gates, provided that all gates are realized with high fidelity. Here, we benchmark both controlled-𝑍 (CZ) and exchange-type (iSWAP) gates using a parametrically driven tunable coupler that mediates the interaction between two superconducting qubits. Using randomized benchmarking protocols we estimate an error per gate of 0.9±0.03 and 1.3±0.4\% for the CZ and the iSWAP gate, respectively. We argue that spurious 𝑍⁢𝑍-type couplings are the dominant error source for the iSWAP gate, and that phase stability of all microwave drives is of utmost importance. Such differences in the achievable fidelities for different two-qubit gates have to be taken into account when mapping quantum algorithms to real hardware.},

  abstract = {The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology is changing rapidly the landscape and modality of research in quantum physics. NISQ devices, such as the IBM Q Experience, have very recently proven their capability as experimental platforms accessible to everyone around the globe. Until now, IBM Q Experience processors have mostly been used for quantum computation and simulation of closed systems. Here, we show that these devices are also able to implement a great variety of paradigmatic open quantum systems models, hence providing a robust and flexible testbed for open quantum systems theory. During the last decade an increasing number of experiments have successfully tackled the task of simulating open quantum systems in different platforms, from linear optics to trapped ions, from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to cavity quantum electrodynamics. Generally, each individual experiment demonstrates a specific open quantum system model, or at most a specific class. Our main result is to prove the great versatility of the IBM Q Experience processors. Indeed, we experimentally implement one and two-qubit open quantum systems, both unital and non-unital dynamics, Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. Moreover, we realise proof-of-principle reservoir engineering for entangled state generation, demonstrate collisional models, and verify revivals of quantum channel capacity and extractable work, caused by memory effects. All these results are obtained using IBM Q Experience processors publicly available and remotely accessible online.},

We discuss theoretical proposals and successful implementations across different multiple-qubit architectures such as spin qubits, trapped ions, photonic and atomic systems, and superconducting circuits.

Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators.

In this paper we are concerned with the modeling of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. We focus on three error groups that represent the main sources of noise during a computation and present quantum channels that model each source. We engineer a noise model that combines all three noise channels and simulates the evolution of the quantum computer using its calibrated error rates. We run various experiments of our model, showcasing its behavior compared to other noise models and an IBM quantum computer. We find that our model provides a better approximation of the quantum computer's behavior than the other models. Following this, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters used by our noise model, bringing the behavior of the model even closer to the quantum computer. Finally, a comparison between the pre- and postoptimization parameters reveals that, according to our model, certain operations can be more or less erroneous than the hardware-calibrated parameters show.},

  abstract = {Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system. We develop a new "Singular value transformation" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain "non-commutative" measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. "Singular value transformation" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.},

  abstract = {Very recently (Cai et al 2010 Phys. Rev. E 82 021921), a simple mechanism was presented by which a molecule subjected to forced oscillations, out of thermal equilibrium, can maintain quantum entanglement between two of its quantum degrees of freedom. Crucially, entanglement can be maintained even in the presence of very intense noise, so intense that no entanglement is possible when the forced oscillations cease. This mechanism may allow for the presence of nontrivial quantum entanglement in biological systems. Here we significantly enlarge the study of this model. In particular, we show that the persistent generation of dynamic entanglement is not restricted to the bosonic heat bath model, but can also be observed in other decoherence models, e.g. the spin gas model, and in non-Markovian scenarios. We also show how conformational changes can be used by an elementary machine to generate entanglement even in unfavorable conditions. In biological systems, similar mechanisms could be exploited by more complex molecular machines or motors.},

  abstract = {Quantum systems are inherently open and susceptible to environmental noise, which can have both detrimental and beneficial effects on their dynamics. This phenomenon has been observed in bio-molecular systems, where noise enables novel functionalities, making the simulation of their dynamics a crucial target for digital and analog quantum simulation. Nevertheless, the computational capabilities of current quantum devices are often limited due to their inherent noise. In this work, we present a novel approach that capitalizes on the intrinsic noise of quantum devices to reduce the computational resources required for simulating open quantum systems. Our approach combines quantum noise characterization methods with quantum error mitigation techniques, enabling us to manipulate and control the intrinsic noise in a quantum circuit. Specifically, we selectively enhance or reduce decoherence rates in the quantum circuit to achieve the desired simulation of open system dynamics. We provide a detailed description of our methods and report on the results of noise characterization and quantum error mitigation experiments conducted on both real and emulated IBM Quantum computers. Additionally, we estimate the experimental resource requirements for our techniques. Our approach holds the potential to unlock new simulation techniques in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, harnessing their intrinsic noise to enhance quantum computations.},

We then apply the algorithm to predict the output state of a process at different times for a system that is coupled to a spin-chain environment. We then reconstruct the full process, and we quantify the non-Markovian memory by means of the bond dimension of the MPO for various properties of the system, of the environment, and of their interaction.

Digital quantum simulations offer greater universality and flexibility over analog simulations. However, digital quantum simulations of open quantum systems face a theoretical challenge; one does not know the solutions of the continuous time master equation for developing quantum gate operators. We give a theoretical framework for digital quantum simulation of ENAQT by introducing new quantum evolution operators. We develop the dynamical equation for the operators and prove that it is an analytical solution of the master equation. As an example, using the dynamical equations, we simulate the FMO complex in the digital setting, reproducing theoretical and experimental evidence of the dynamics. The framework gives an optimal method for quantum circuit implementation, giving a log reduction in complexity over known methods. The generic framework can be extrapolated to study other open quantum systems.},

Most of this work has focused on the standard case where energy is the only conserved quantity. Here we consider a generalization of this work to deal with multiple conserved quantities. Each conserved quantity, which, importantly, need not commute with the rest, can be extracted and stored in its own battery. Unlike the standard case, in which the amount of extractable energy is constrained, here there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them. We present explicit protocols that allow us to perform arbitrarily good trade-offs and extract arbitrarily good combinations of conserved quantities from individual quantum systems.},

A somewhat related class of problems focuses on finding optimal distributions of weights which, for a given connection topology, maximize some kind of flow or minimize a given cost function. We show that both sets of problems can be approached through an analysis of the large-deviation functions of random walks. Specifically, a study of ensembles of trajectories allows us to find optimal paths, or design optimal weighted networks, by means of an auxiliary stochastic process (the generalized Doob transform). The paths are not limited to shortest paths, and the weights must not necessarily optimize a given function. Paths and weights can in fact be tailored to a given statistics of a time-integrated observable, which may be an activity or current, or local functions marking the passing of the random walker through a given node or link. We illustrate this idea with an exploration of optimal paths in the presence of obstacles, and networks that optimize flows under constraints on local observables.},

In this work, we aim at closing the gap by proving two anticoncentration theorems and accompanying hardness results, one for circuit-based schemes, the other for quantum quench-type schemes for quantum simulations. Compared to the few other known such results, these results give rise to a number of comparably simple, physically meaningful and resource-economical schemes showing a quantum speedup in one and two spatial dimensions. At the heart of the analysis are tools of unitary designs and random circuits that allow us to conclude that universal random circuits anticoncentrate as well as an embedding of known circuit-based schemes in a 2D translation-invariant architecture.},

Evolving an open system unitarily necessitates dilation into a new effective system to incorporate critical environmental degrees of freedom. In this context, we present and validate a new quantum algorithm to treat non-Markovian dynamics in OQSs built on the ensemble of Lindblad's trajectories approach, invoking the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem. Here we demonstrate our algorithm on the Jaynes-Cummings model in the strong-coupling and detuned regimes, relevant in quantum optics and driven quantum system studies. This algorithm, a key step towards generalized modeling of non-Markovian dynamics on a noisy-quantum device, captures a broad class of dynamics and opens up a new direction in OQS problems.},

A notable obstacle occurs when some of the observables do not commute, and so it is impossible for the observables to simultaneously take on sharp microscopic values. We show how this can be circumvented, discuss information-theoretic aspects of the setting, and explain how thermodynamic costs can be traded between the different observables.

  abstract = {Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers, amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data, owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data. To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning. In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision, Recall, and F-measure in each case.},

Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data, owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data. To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning. In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision, Recall, and F-measure in each case.},

  abstract = {Although it has been known for almost half a century that migratory birds can detect the direction of the Earth\&apos;s magnetic field, the primary sensory mechanism behind this remarkable feat is still unclear. The leading hypothesis centers on radical pairs—magnetically sensitive chemical intermediates formed by photoexcitation of cryptochrome proteins in the retina. Our primary aim here is to explain the chemical and physical aspects of the radical-pair mechanism to biologists and the biological and chemical aspects to physicists. In doing so, we review the current state of knowledge on magnetoreception mechanisms. We dare to hope that this tutorial will stimulate new interdisciplinary experimental and theoretical work that will shed much-needed additional light on this fascinating problem in sensory biology.},

In this work we propose and demonstrate a general quantum algorithm to evolve open quantum dynamics on quantum computing devices. The Kraus operators governing the time evolution can be converted into unitary matrices with minimal dilation guaranteed by the Sz.-Nagy theorem. This allows the evolution of the initial state through unitary quantum gates, while using significantly less resource than required by the conventional Stinespring dilation. We demonstrate the algorithm on an amplitude damping channel using the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator and the IBM Q 5 Tenerife quantum device. The proposed algorithm does not require particular models of dynamics or decomposition of the quantum channel, and thus can be easily generalized to other open quantum dynamical models.},

The complexity of this task is commonly characterised by its sample-complexity: the minimal number of samples needed to reach a certain target precision of the description. While the sample complexity of quantum state tomography has been well studied, the memory complexity has not been investigated in depth. Indeed, the bottleneck in the implementation of na\textbackslash "ive sample-optimal quantum state tomography is its massive quantum memory requirements.

  abstract = {The observation of long-lived electronic coherence in a photosynthetic pigment–protein complex, the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) complex, is suggestive that quantum coherence might play a significant role in achieving the remarkable efficiency of photosynthetic electronic energy transfer (EET), although the data were acquired at cryogenic temperature [Engel GS, et al. (2007) Evidence for wavelike energy transfer through quantum coherence in photosynthetic systems. Nature 446:782–786]. In this paper, the spatial and temporal dynamics of EET through the FMO complex at physiological temperature are investigated theoretically. The numerical results reveal that quantum wave-like motion persists for several hundred femtoseconds even at physiological temperature, and suggest that the FMO complex may work as a rectifier for unidirectional energy flow from the peripheral light-harvesting antenna to the reaction center complex by taking advantage of quantum coherence and the energy landscape of pigments tuned by the protein scaffold. A potential role of quantum coherence is to overcome local energetic traps and aid efficient trapping of electronic energy by the pigments facing the reaction center complex.},

  abstract = {Characterising complex quantum systems is a vital task in quantum information science. Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a well-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes. It is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal reconstruction technique known as ‘compressed sensing’ has been ported to quantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can be achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed sensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special property of quantum mechanics itself—that the mathematical objects that describe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with non-negative eigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is understood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information obtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a new sense of ‘informational completeness.’ This has important consequences on the efficiency of the data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and modelling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical tool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert space. Although we mainly present our results in the context of quantum tomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix recovery.},

  abstract = {Often quantum systems are not isolated and interactions with their environments must be taken into account. In such open quantum systems these environmental interactions can lead to decoherence and dissipation, which have a marked influence on the properties of the quantum system. In many instances the environment is well-approximated by classical mechanics, so that one is led to consider the dynamics of open quantum-classical systems. Since a full quantum dynamical description of large many-body systems is not currently feasible, mixed quantum-classical methods can provide accurate and computationally tractable ways to follow the dynamics of both the system and its environment. This review focuses on quantum-classical Liouville dynamics, one of several quantum-classical descriptions, and discusses the problems that arise when one attempts to combine quantum and classical mechanics, coherence and decoherence in quantum-classical systems, nonadiabatic dynamics, surface-hopping and mean-field theories and their relation to quantum-classical Liouville dynamics, as well as methods for simulating the dynamics.},

The dots are chosen to be in the regime of spin-charge hybridization to enhance their sensitivity to the RLC circuits while mitigating the detrimental effects of unwanted noise. In this context, we establish an experimentally realizable map between the hybrid system and a qubit coupled to thermal harmonic environments of arbitrary complexity that enables the analog quantum simulation of open quantum systems. We assess the utility of the simulator by numerically exact emulations that indicate that the experimental setup can faithfully mimic the intended target even in the presence of its natural inherent noise. We further provide a detailed analysis of the physical requirements on the quantum dots and the RLC circuits needed to experimentally realize this proposal that indicates that the simulator can be created with existing technology. The approach can exactly capture the effects of highly structured non-Markovian quantum environments typical of photosynthesis and chemical dynamics and it offers clear potential advantages over conventional and even quantum computation. The proposal opens up a general path for effective quantum dynamics simulations based on semiconductor quantum dots.},

An immediate consequence is that dissipative quantum computing is no more powerful than the unitary circuit model. Our result can be seen as a dissipative Church-Turing theorem, since it implies that under natural assumptions, such as weak coupling to an environment, the dynamics of an open quantum system can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. Formally, we introduce a Trotter decomposition for Liouvillian dynamics and give explicit error bounds. This constitutes a practical tool for numerical simulations, e.g., using matrix-product operators. We also demonstrate that most quantum states cannot be prepared efficiently.},

Compared to static data mining, processing streams imposes new computational requirements for algorithms to incrementally process incoming examples while using limited memory and time. Furthermore, due to the non-stationary characteristics of streaming data, prediction models are often also required to adapt to concept drifts. Out of several new proposed stream algorithms, ensembles play an important role, in particular for non-stationary environments. This paper surveys research on ensembles for data stream classification as well as regression tasks. Besides presenting a comprehensive spectrum of ensemble approaches for data streams, we also discuss advanced learning concepts such as imbalanced data streams, novelty detection, active and semi-supervised learning, complex data representations and structured outputs. The paper concludes with a discussion of open research problems and lines of future research.},

Like quantum state tomography, the process tomography of an arbitrary quantum channel requires a number of measurements that scales exponentially in the number of quantum bits affected. However, the recent field of shadow tomography, applied to quantum states, has demonstrated the ability to extract key information about a state with only polynomially many measurements. In this work, we apply the concepts of shadow state tomography to the challenge of characterizing quantum processes. We make use of the Choi isomorphism to directly apply rigorous bounds from shadow state tomography to shadow process tomography, and we find additional bounds on the number of measurements that are unique to process tomography. Our results, which include algorithms for implementing shadow process tomography, enable new techniques including evaluation of channel concatenation and the application of channels to shadows of quantum states. This provides a dramatic improvement for understanding large-scale quantum systems.},

The form of the spectral functions can be tuned digitally, allowing for the time evolution of a wide range of open-system models at finite temperature. We study the feasibility of this approach with a focus on the solution of the spin-boson model and assume intrinsic qubit noise that is dominated by damping and dephasing. We find that classes of open quantum systems exist where our algorithm performs very well, even with gate errors as high as 1\%.

Under the constraint that the number of samples is bounded, either in expectation or with high probability, we exhibit adaptive strategies that minimize both types of misidentification errors. Namely, we show that these errors decrease exponentially (in the stopping time) with decay rates given by the measured relative entropies between the two states. Moreover, if we allow joint measurements on multiple samples, the rates are increased to the respective quantum relative entropies. We also fully characterize the achievable error exponents for non-adaptive strategies and provide numerical evidence showing that adaptive measurements are necessary to achieve our bounds.},

Here, by first proposing the concept of quantum process verification, we establish two efficient and practical protocols for verifying quantum processes which can provide an exponential improvement over the standard quantum process tomography and a quadratic improvement over the method of direct fidelity estimation. The efficacy of our protocols is illustrated with the verification of various quantum gates as well as the processes of well-known quantum circuits. Moreover, our protocols are readily applicable with current experimental techniques since only local measurements are required. In addition, we show that our protocols for verifying quantum processes can be easily adapted to verify quantum measurements.},

The algorithm of compressed sampling is employed to solve the optimization problem. Experiments are demonstrated considering 4-qubit photonic states. The results show that (1) much fewer measurements than the standard tomography are sufficient to obtain high fidelity, and (2) the method of maximizing likelihood is more accurate and noise robust than the original reconstruction method of compressed sampling.

We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices},

  abstract = {Recently, the dynamics simulation of light-harvesting complexes as an open quantum system, in the weak and strong coupling regimes, has received much attention. In this paper, we investigate a digital quantum simulation approach of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) photosynthetic pigment-protein complex surrounded with a Markovian bath, i.e. memoryless, based on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer. For this purpose, we apply the decoupling (recoupling) method, which is turn off (on) the couplings, and also Solovay–Kitaev techniques to decompose Hamiltonian and Lindbladians into efficient elementary gates on an NMR simulator. Finally, we design the quantum circuits for the unitary and nonunitary part due to the system-environment interactions of the open system dynamics.},

  abstract = {Strong symmetries in open quantum systems lead to broken ergodicity and the emergence of multiple degenerate steady states. From a quantum jump (trajectory) perspective, the appearance of multiple steady states is related to underlying dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) at the fluctuating level, leading to a dynamical coexistence of different transport channels classified by symmetry. In this paper we investigate how strong symmetries affect both the transport properties and the activity patterns of a particular class of Markovian open quantum system, a three-qubit model under the action of a magnetic field and in contact with a thermal bath. We find a pair of twin DPTs in exciton current statistics, induced by the strong symmetry and related by time reversibility, where a zero-current exchange-antisymmetric phase coexists with a symmetric phase of negative exciton current. On the other hand, the activity statistics exhibits a single DPT where the symmetric and antisymmetric phases of different but nonzero activities dynamically coexists. Interestingly, the maximum current and maximum activity phases do not coincide for this three-qubits system. We also investigate how symmetries are reflected in the joint large deviation statistics of the activity and the current, a central issue in the characterization of the complex quantum jump dynamics. The presence of a strong symmetry under nonequilibrium conditions implies non-analyticities in the dynamical free energy in the dual activity-current plane (or equivalently in the joint activity-current large deviation function), including an activity-driven current lockdown phase for activities below some critical threshold. Remarkably, the DPT predicted around the steady state and its Gallavotti–Cohen twin dual are extended into lines of first-order DPTs in the current-activity plane, with a nontrivial structure which depends on the transport and activity properties of each of the symmetry phases. Finally, we also study the effect of a symmetry-breaking, ergodicity-restoring dephasing channel on the coupled activity-current statistics for this model. Interestingly, we observe that while this dephasing noise destroys the symmetry-induced DPTs, the underlying topological symmetry leaves a dynamical fingerprint in the form of an intermittent, bursty on/off dynamics between the different symmetry sectors.},

This reduction leads to the expression for ballistic energy fluxes in uniform fermionic and bosonic lattices. By the use of the Jordan–Wigner transformation we can extend our analysis to spin lattices, proving the coexistence of both ballistic and non-ballistic subspaces in any dimension and for any system size. We then relate the nature of transport to the number of excitations in the homogeneous spin lattice, indicating that a single excitation always propagates ballistically and that the non-ballistic behaviour of uniform spin lattices is a consequence of the interaction between different excitations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Computational drug repositioning can lead to a considerable reduction in cost and time in any drug development process. Recent approaches have addressed the network-based nature of biological information for performing complex prioritization tasks. In this work, we propose a new methodology based on heterogeneous network prioritization that can aid researchers in the drug repositioning process. METHODS: We have developed DrugNet, a new methodology for drug-disease and disease-drug prioritization. Our approach is based on a network-based prioritization method called ProphNet which has recently been developed by the authors. ProphNet is able to integrate data from complex networks involving a wide range of types of elements and interactions. In this work, we built a network of interconnected drugs, proteins and diseases and applied DrugNet to different types of tests for drug repositioning. RESULTS: We tested the performance of our approach on different validation tests, including cross validation and tests based on real clinical trials. DrugNet achieved a mean AUC value of 0.9552±0.0015 in 5-fold cross validation tests, and a mean AUC value of 0.8364 for tests based on recent clinical trials (phases 0-4) not present in our data. These results suggest that DrugNet could be very useful for discovering new drug uses. We also studied specific cases of particular interest, proving the benefits of heterogeneous data integration in this problem. CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology suggests that new drugs can be repositioned by generating ranked lists of drugs based on a given disease query or vice versa. Our study shows that the simultaneous integration of information about diseases, drugs and targets can lead to a significant improvement in drug repositioning tasks. DrugNet is available as a web tool from http://genome2.ugr.es/drugnet/ (accessed 23.09.14). Matlab source code is also available on the website.},

This review provides a two-fold overview of several key approaches that can offer advancements in both the development of quantum technologies and the power of artificial intelligence. Among these approaches are quantum-enhanced algorithms, which apply quantum software engineering to classical information processing to improve keystone machine learning solutions. In this context, we explore the capability of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to improve model generalization and increase accuracy while reducing computational resources. We also illustrate how machine learning can be used both to mitigate the effects of errors on presently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, and to understand quantum advantage via an automatic study of quantum walk processes on graphs. In addition, we review how quantum hardware can be enhanced by applying machine learning to fundamental and applied physics problems as well as quantum tomography and photonics. We aim to demonstrate how concepts in physics can be translated into practical engineering of machine learning solutions using quantum software.

  abstract = {Quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics simulations are traditionally based on implementing a Trotter-approximation of the time-evolution operator. This approach typically relies on deep circuits and is therefore hampered by the substantial limitations of available noisy and near-term quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms have become an indispensable alternative, enabling small-scale simulations on present-day hardware. However, despite the recent development of variational quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics, a detailed assessment of their efficiency and scalability is yet to be presented. To fill this gap, we applied a variational quantum algorithm based on McLachlan's principle to simulate the dynamics of a spin-boson model subject to varying levels of realistic hardware noise as well as in different physical regimes, and discuss the algorithm's accuracy and scaling behavior as a function of system size. We observe a good performance of the variational approach used in combination with a general, physically motivated wavefunction ansatz, and compare it to the conventional first-order Trotter-evolution. Finally, based on this, we make scaling predictions for the simulation of a classically intractable system. We show that, despite providing a clear reduction of quantum gate cost, the variational method in its current implementation is unlikely to lead to a quantum advantage for the solution of time-dependent problems.},

Here we present an alternative “direct characterization of quantum dynamics” (DCQD) algorithm. In contrast to all known QPT methods, this algorithm relies on error-detection techniques and does not require any quantum state tomography. We illustrate that, by construction, the DCQD algorithm can be applied to the task of obtaining partial information about quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the DCQD algorithm is experimentally implementable in a variety of prominent quantum-informatiom processing systems, and show how it can be realized in photonic systems with present day technology.},

  abstract = {The characterization of the dynamics of quantum systems is a task of both fundamental and practical importance. A general class of methods which have been developed in quantum information theory to accomplish this task is known as quantum process tomography (QPT). In an earlier paper [M. Mohseni and D. A. Lidar Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 170501 (2006)] we presented an algorithm for direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD) of two-level quantum systems. Here we provide a generalization by developing a theory for direct and complete characterization of the dynamics of arbitrary quantum systems. In contrast to other QPT schemes, DCQD relies on quantum error-detection techniques and does not require any quantum state tomography. We demonstrate that for the full characterization of the dynamics of 𝑛 𝑑-level quantum systems (with 𝑑 prime), the minimal number of required experimental configurations is reduced quadratically from in separable QPT schemes to in DCQD.},

  abstract = {Characterization of quantum dynamics is a fundamental problem in quantum physics and quantum-information science. Several methods are known which achieve this goal, namely standard quantum-process tomography (SQPT), ancilla-assisted process tomography, and the recently proposed scheme of direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD). Here, we review these schemes and analyze them with respect to some of the physical resources they require. Although a reliable figure-of-merit for process characterization is not yet available, our analysis can provide a benchmark which is necessary for choosing the scheme that is the most appropriate in a given situation, with given resources. As a result, we conclude that for quantum systems where two-body interactions are not naturally available, SQPT is the most efficient scheme. However, for quantum systems with controllable two-body interactions, the DCQD scheme is more efficient than other known quantum-process tomography schemes in terms of the total number of required elementary quantum operations.},

  abstract = {In supervised learning, an inductive learning algorithm extracts general rules from observed training instances, then the rules are applied to test instances. We show that this splitting of training and application arises naturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirement with a physical interpretation of being nonsignaling. Thus, two seemingly different definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This follows from the properties of classical information that break down in the quantum setup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels, which shows that in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptotic setting, that is, for large numbers of test instances. This reveals a natural analogy between classical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, justifying a similar treatment, and allowing us to inquire about standard elements in computational learning theory, such as structural risk minimization and sample complexity.},

In particular, it applies when no initial information about the parameter value is available, e.g., when few measurements are performed. Here, we consider three paradigmatic estimation schemes in continuous-variable (CV) quantum metrology (estimation of displacements, phases, and squeezing strengths) and analyse them from the Bayesian perspective. For each of these scenarios, we investigate the precision achievable with single-mode Gaussian states under homodyne and heterodyne detection. This allows us to identify Bayesian estimation strategies that combine good performance with the potential for straightforward experimental realization in terms of Gaussian states and measurements. Our results provide practical solutions for reaching uncertainties where local estimation techniques apply, thus bridging the gap to regimes where asymptotically optimal strategies can be employed.},

The first is based on measurements in mutually unbiased bases and the second is based on equiangular measurements. Both criteria give a qualitative result in terms of the state’s entanglement dimension and a quantitative result in terms of its fidelity with the maximally entangled state. The criteria are universally applicable since no assumptions on the state are required. Moreover, the experimenter can control the trade-off between resource-efficiency and noise-tolerance by selecting the number of measurements performed. For paradigmatic noise models, we show that only a small number of measurements are necessary to achieve nearly-optimal detection in any dimension. The number of global product projections scales only linearly in the local dimension, thus paving the way for detection and quantification of very high-dimensional entanglement.},

In particular, as an example, we discuss simulation of the chlorosome light-harvesting antenna from green sulfur bacteria with over 250 phonon modes coupled to each electronic state. Furthermore, we propose physical setups that can be used to reproduce the quantum dynamics of a standard and multiple-mode Holstein model.

A famous example is electronic excitation transfer in the initial stage of photosynthesis, where harvested energy is transferred with remarkably high efficiency to a reaction center. This transport is affected by the motion of a structured vibrational environment, which makes simulations on a classical computer very demanding. Here we propose an analog quantum simulator of complex open system dynamics with a precisely engineered quantum environment. Our setup is based on superconducting circuits, a well established technology. As an example, we demonstrate that it is feasible to simulate exciton transport in the Fenna–Matthews–Olson photosynthetic complex. Our approach allows for a controllable single-molecule simulation and the investigation of energy transfer pathways as well as non-Markovian noise-correlation effects.},

However, these approaches usually limit their scope to a single biological entity type of interest or they lack the flexibility to analyze user-defined data.We developed ProphTools, a flexible open-source command-line tool that performs prioritization on a heterogeneous network. ProphTools prioritization combines a Flow Propagation algorithm similar to a Random Walk with Restarts and a weighted propagation method. A flexible model for the representation of a heterogeneous network allows the user to define a prioritization problem involving an arbitrary number of entity types and their interconnections. Furthermore, ProphTools provides functionality to perform cross-validation tests, allowing users to select the best network configuration for a given problem. ProphTools core prioritization methodology has already been proven effective in gene-disease prioritization and drug repositioning. Here we make ProphTools available to the scientific community as flexible, open-source software and perform a new proof-of-concept case study on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to disease prioritization.ProphTools is robust prioritization software that provides the flexibility not present in other state-of-the-art network analysis approaches, enabling researchers to perform prioritization tasks on any user-defined heterogeneous network. Furthermore, the application to lncRNA-disease prioritization shows that ProphTools can reach the performance levels of ad hoc prioritization tools without losing its generality.},

Traditional tomography is limited to a handful of qubits, and shadow tomography has been suggested as a scalable replacement for larger systems. Shadow tomography is conventionally analyzed based on outcomes of ideal projective measurements on the system upon application of randomized unitaries. Here, we suggest that shadow tomography can be much more straightforwardly formulated for generalized measurements, or positive operator valued measures. Based on the idea of the least-square estimator shadow tomography with generalized measurements is both more general and simpler than the traditional formulation with randomization of unitaries. In particular, this formulation allows us to analyze theoretical aspects of shadow tomography in detail. For example, we provide a detailed study of the implication of symmetries in shadow tomography. Moreover, with this generalization we also demonstrate how the optimization of measurements for shadow tomography tailored toward a particular set of observables can be carried out.},

  abstract = {Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is                                                      calibration-free                                                  . GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a                                                      gate set                                                  simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets.

Gate-dependent non-Markovian errors caused by TLS-qubit coupling are detrimental to fault-tolerant quantum computation and have not been rigorously treated in the existing literature. In this work, we derive the non-Markovian dynamics between TLS and qubits during a SWAP-like two-qubit gate and the associated average gate fidelity for frequency-tunable Transmon qubits. This gate dependent error model facilitates using qubits as sensors to simultaneously learn practical imperfections in both the qubit's environment and control waveforms. We combine the-state-of-art machine learning algorithm with Moir\textbackslash '\{e\}-enhanced swap spectroscopy to achieve robust learning using noisy experimental data. Deep neural networks are used to represent the functional map from experimental data to TLS parameters and are trained through an evolutionary algorithm. Our method achieves the highest learning efficiency and robustness against experimental imperfections to-date, representing an important step towards in-situ quantum control optimization over environmental and control defects.},

In this work, we investigate whether quantum advantage demonstrations can be achieved for more physically-motivated sampling problems, related to measurements of physical observables. We focus on the problem of sampling the outcomes of an energy measurement, performed on a simple-to-prepare product quantum state - a problem we refer to as energy sampling. For different regimes of measurement resolution and measurement errors, we provide complexity theoretic arguments showing that the existence of efficient classical algorithms for energy sampling is unlikely. In particular, we describe a family of Hamiltonians with nearest-neighbour interactions on a 2D lattice that can be efficiently measured with high resolution using a quantum circuit of commuting gates (IQP circuit), whereas an efficient classical simulation of this process should be impossible. In this high resolution regime, which can only be achieved for Hamiltonians that can be exponentially fast-forwarded, it is possible to use current theoretical tools tying quantum advantage statements to a polynomial-hierarchy collapse whereas for lower resolution measurements such arguments fail. Nevertheless, we show that efficient classical algorithms for low-resolution energy sampling can still be ruled out if we assume that quantum computers are strictly more powerful than classical ones. We believe our work brings a new perspective to the problem of demonstrating quantum advantage and leads to interesting new questions in Hamiltonian complexity.},

Our method reduces the accumulation of errors in any circuit composed of single- or two-qubit gates expressed as \$e\textasciicircum\{-i \textbackslash sigma\textbackslash theta \}\$ for Pauli operators \$\textbackslash sigma\$ and \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash in [0,\textbackslash pi)\$; since such gates form a universal gate set, our results apply to a strictly larger class of circuits than those comprising only Clifford gates, thereby generalizing previous results. In the case of coherent errors -- which include crosstalk -- we demonstrate a reduction of the error scaling in an \$L\$-depth circuit from \$O(L)\$ to \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{L\})\$. Crucially, REAS makes no assumption on the cleanness of the error-suppressing protocol itself and is, therefore, truly robust, applying to situations in which the newly inserted gates have non-negligible coherent noise. Furthermore, we show that REAS can also suppress certain types of decoherence noise by transforming some gates to be robust against such noise, which is verified by the demonstration of the quadratic suppression of error scaling in the numerical simulation. Our results, therefore, present an advanced, robust method of error suppression that can be used in conjunction with error correction as a viable path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

  abstract = {ConspectusSimulating molecular dynamics (MD) within a comprehensive quantum framework has been a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry. An exponential scaling of computational cost renders solving the time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) of a molecular Hamiltonian, including both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom (DOFs), as well as their couplings, infeasible for more than a few DOFs. In the Born–Oppenheimer (BO), or adiabatic, picture, electronic and nuclear parts of the wave function are decoupled and treated separately. Within this framework, the nuclear wave function evolves along potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed as solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation parametrized in the nuclear DOFs. This approximation, together with increasingly elaborate numerical approaches to solve the nuclear time dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), enabled the treatment of up to a few dozens of degrees of freedom (DOFs). However, for particular applications, such as photochemistry, the BO approximation breaks down. In this regime of non-adiabatic dynamics, solving the full molecular problem including electron–nuclear couplings becomes essential, further increasing the complexity of the numerical solution. Although valuable methods such as multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) have been proposed for the solution of the coupled electron–nuclear dynamics, they remain hampered by an exponential scaling in the number of nuclear DOFs and by the difficulty of finding universal variational forms.In this Account, we present a perspective on novel quantum computational algorithms, aiming to alleviate the exponential scaling inherent to the simulation of many-body quantum dynamics. In particular, we focus on the derivation and application of quantum algorithms for adiabatic and non-adiabatic quantum dynamics, which include efficient approaches for the calculation of the BO potential energy surfaces (PESs). Thereafter, we study the time-evolution of a model system consisting of two coupled PESs in first and second quantization. In a first application, we discuss a recently introduced quantum algorithm for the evolution of a wavepacket in first quantization and exploit the potential quantum advantage of mapping its spatial grid representation to logarithmically many qubits. For the second demonstration, we move to the second quantization framework and review the scaling properties of two alternative time-evolution algorithms, namely, a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) (based on the McLachlan variational principle) and conventional Trotter-type evolution (based on a Lie–Trotter–Suzuki formula). Both methods clearly demonstrate the potential of quantum algorithms and their favorable scaling compared to the available classical approaches. However, a clear demonstration of quantum advantage in the context of molecular quantum dynamics may require the implementation of these algorithms in fault-tolerant quantum computers, while their application in near-term, noisy quantum devices is still unclear and deserves further investigation.},

Classically, the simulation of such reactions is limited by the unfavorable scaling of the computational resources as a function of the system size. While quantum computing exhibits proven quantum advantage for the simulation of real-time dynamics, the study of quantum algorithms for the description of nonadiabatic phenomena is still unexplored. In this Letter, we propose a quantum algorithm for the simulation of fast nonadiabatic chemical processes together with an initialization scheme for quantum hardware calculations. In particular, we introduce a first-quantization method for the time evolution of a wave packet on two coupled harmonic potential energy surfaces (Marcus model). In our approach, the computational resources scale polynomially in the system dimensions, opening up new avenues for the study of photophysical processes that are classically intractable.},

  abstract = {A quantum control landscape is defined as the expectation value of a target observable Θ as a function of the control variables. In this work, control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are analyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density matrix ρi into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation value of the observable Θ. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the system N, the initial state ρi and the target observable Θ. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in ρi remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant dependence on N. If ρi has no zero eigenvalues, then the computational complexity and the required search effort rise with N. The dimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes the objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search efficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control modeled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value of the objective than coherent control modeled by unitary maps. Numerical simulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints on the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these landscapes.},

  abstract = {All clocks, in some form or another, use the evolution of nature toward higher entropy states to quantify the passage of time. Because of the statistical nature of the second law and corresponding entropy flows, fluctuations fundamentally limit the performance of any clock. This suggests a deep relation between the increase in entropy and the quality of clock ticks. Indeed, minimal models for autonomous clocks in the quantum realm revealed that a linear relation can be derived, where for a limited regime every bit of entropy linearly increases the accuracy of quantum clocks. But can such a linear relation persist as we move toward a more classical system? We answer this in the affirmative by presenting the first experimental investigation of this thermodynamic relation in a nanoscale clock. We stochastically drive a nanometer-thick membrane and read out its displacement with a radio-frequency cavity, allowing us to identify the ticks of a clock. We show theoretically that the maximum possible accuracy for this classical clock is proportional to the entropy created per tick, similar to the known limit for a weakly coupled quantum clock but with a different proportionality constant. We measure both the accuracy and the entropy. Once nonthermal noise is accounted for, we find that there is a linear relation between accuracy and entropy and that the clock operates within an order of magnitude of the theoretical bound.},

We explore a family of cat states, , and describe circuit gadgets using them to concurrently inject non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) and entanglement into any quantum circuit. We provide numerical evidence that cat-state injection does not lead to speed-up in classical simulation. On the other hand, we show that our gadgets can be used to widen the scope of compelling applications of cat states. Specifically, we show how to leverage them to achieve savings in the number of injected qubits, and also to induce scrambling dynamics in otherwise non-entangling Clifford circuits in a controlled manner.},

Here we generalize PBC for odd-prime-dimensional systems and demonstrate its universality. Additionally, we discuss how any qudit-based PBC can be implemented on actual, circuit-based quantum hardware. Our results show that we can translate a PBC on 𝑛𝑝-dimensional qudits to adaptive circuits on 𝑛+1 qudits with 𝑂⁢(𝑝⁢𝑛2/2) sum gates and depth. Alternatively, we can carry out the same computation with 𝑂⁢(𝑝⁢𝑛/2) depth at the expense of an increased circuit width. Finally, we show that the sampling complexity associated with simulating a number 𝑘 of virtual qudits is related to the robustness of magic of the input states. Computation of this magic monotone for qutrit and ququint states leads to sampling complexity upper bounds of, respectively, 𝑂⁡(31.0848⁢𝑘⁢𝜀−2) and 𝑂⁡(51.4022⁢𝑘⁢𝜀−2), for a desired precision 𝜀. We further establish lower bounds to this sampling complexity for qubits, qutrits, and ququints: Ω⁡(20.5431⁢𝑘⁢𝜀−2), Ω⁡(30.7236⁢𝑘⁢𝜀−2), and Ω⁡(50.8544⁢𝑘⁢𝜀−2), respectively.},

Our schemes reduce the number of quantum gates to \$O(t\textasciicircum 2)\$ (from a previous \$O(t\textasciicircum 3 / \textbackslash log t)\$ scaling) and space/time trade-offs are discussed which lead to a reduction of the depth from \$O(t \textbackslash log t)\$ to \$O(t)\$ within our schemes, at the cost of \$t\$ additional auxiliary qubits. We compile examples of random and hidden-shift quantum circuits into adaptive PBC circuits. We also simulate hybrid quantum computation, where a classical computer effectively extends the working memory of a small quantum computer by \$k\$ virtual qubits, at a cost exponential in \$k\$.

This leads to cooperative effects and a relaxation dynamics displaying space-time heterogeneity similar to what is observed in the relaxation of glass-forming systems. Here, we establish theoretically the existence of a glassy dynamical regime in an open Rydberg gas, associated with phase coexistence at a first-order transition in dynamical large deviation functions. This transition occurs between an active phase of low density in which dynamical processes take place on short timescales, and an inactive phase in which excited atoms are dense and the dynamics is highly arrested. We perform a numerically exact study and develop a mean-field approach that allows us to understand the mechanics of this phase transition. We show that radiative decay—which becomes experimentally relevant for long times—moves the system away from dynamical phase coexistence. Nevertheless, the dynamical phase transition persists and causes strong fluctuations in the observed dynamics.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent success of deep learning for time series forecasting, these methods are not scalable for many real-world applications where data arrives sequentially. Training deep neural forecasters on the fly is notoriously challenging because of their limited ability to adapt to non-stationary environments and remember old knowledge. We argue that the fast adaptation capability of deep neural networks is critical and successful solutions require handling changes to both new and recurring patterns effectively. In this work, inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, we propose Fast and Slow learning Network (FSNet) as a novel framework to address the challenges of online forecasting. Particularly, FSNet improves the slowly-learned backbone by dynamically balancing fast adaptation to recent changes and retrieving similar old knowledge. FSNet achieves this mechanism via an interaction between two novel complementary components: (i) a per-layer adapter to support fast learning from individual layers, and (ii) an associative memory to support remembering, updating, and recalling repeating events. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets validate FSNet's efficacy and robustness to both new and recurring patterns.

With the first meaning, teleportation is theoretically possible by placing the particle initially at rest (with a certain uncertainty) out of any equilibrium point of a potential well or barrier and by frequently monitoring whether the particle remains at rest. This quantum Zeno dynamics inhibits acceleration, and features disappearance from the classical turning point and appearance in another turning point, if there is any other, with a probability that approaches unity by increasing the frequency of the measurements. This phenomenon has all the ingredients attributed in science fiction to teleportation: The particle is always at rest, cannot be found in the path between the two turning points, and saves travel time. We discuss the feasibility, in principle, of teleportation of electrons, protons, and other particles, and conclude its increasing impracticability as the particle gets heavier. Nevertheless, our paper establishes a basis for further studies in which the projective and instantaneous measurements are replaced by more realistic models.},

The high efficiency of this process is believed to be enabled by an interplay between the quantum nature of molecular structures in photosynthetic complexes and their interaction with the environment. Investigating these effects in biological samples is challenging due to their complex and disordered structure. Here we experimentally demonstrate a technique for studying photosynthetic models based on superconducting quantum circuits, which complements existing experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of freedom in design and experimental control of our approach based on a simplified three-site model of a pigment protein complex with realistic parameters scaled down in energy by a factor of 105. We show that the excitation transport between quantum-coherent sites disordered in energy can be enabled through the interaction with environmental noise. We also show that the efficiency of the process is maximized for structured noise resembling intramolecular phononic environments found in photosynthetic complexes.},

This is the case, in particular, when the Markov chain is ergodic and its transition matrix is symmetric. This generalizes the celebrated result of L. K. Grover (1996)and a number of more recent results, including the element distinctness result of Ambainis and the result of Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh that computes properties of quantum walks on the d-dimensional torus. Among the consequences is a faster search for multiple marked items. We show that the quantum escape time, just like its classical version, depends on the spectral properties of the transition matrix with the marked rows and columns deleted.},

For nonequilibrium protocols, in which the probe is measured before reaching equilibrium with the sample, we find new behaviour of the measurement sensitivity arising due to non-Markovian dynamics. First, we show that the QFI displays a highly non-monotonic behaviour in time, in contrast to the Markovian case where it grows monotonically until equilibrium, so that non-Markovian revivals can be exploited to reach a higher QFI. Second, the QFI rate is maximised at a finite interrogation time , which we characterize, in contrast to the solution known in the Markovian limit (Pavel Sekatski and Martí Perarnau-Llobet 2022 Quantum 6 869). Finally, we consider probes make up of few fermions and discuss different collective enhancements in the measurement precision.},

We study the measure in the hierarchical equation of motion approach which captures strong coupling effects and nonequilibrium molecular reorganization. We propose an additional trace distance measure for the information flow that could be extended to other master equations. We find that for a model dimer system and for the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex the non-Markovianity is significant under physiological conditions.},

One must choose the appropriate benchmark and metrics to extract meaningful results. Different benchmarks test the system in different ways, and each individual metric may or may not be of interest. Choosing the appropriate approach is tricky. The situation is even more open ended for quantum computers, where there is a wider range of hardware, fewer established guidelines, and additional complicating factors. Notably, quantum noise significantly impacts performance and is difficult to model accurately. Here, we discuss benchmarking of quantum computers from a computer architecture perspective and provide numerical simulations highlighting challenges that suggest caution.},

We provide numerical simulations that suggest that the Fenna–Matthews–Olson complex of green sulfur bacteria has an excitonic structure that is close to such an optimal operating point, and place the phonon antenna concept into a broader context that leads us to conjecture that this general design principle might well be exploited in other biomolecular systems.},

NMQSD is an open quantum system approach that incorporates environmental degrees of freedom (the vibrations in our case) in a stochastic way. We show in this paper that for linear optical spectra (absorption, circular dichroism), no stochastics is needed, even for finite temperatures. Thus, the spectra can be obtained by propagating a single trajectory. To this end, we map a finite temperature environment to the zero temperature case using the so-called thermofield method. The resulting equations can then be solved efficiently by standard integrators.},

  abstract = {We apply the method of compressed sensing (CS) quantum process tomography (QPT) to characterize quantum gates based on superconducting Xmon and phase qubits. Using experimental data for a two-qubit controlled-Z gate, we obtain an estimate for the process matrix 𝜒 with reasonably high fidelity compared to full QPT, but using a significantly reduced set of initial states and measurement configurations. We show that the CS method still works when the amount of used data is so small that the standard QPT would have an underdetermined system of equations. We also apply the CS method to the analysis of the three-qubit Toffoli gate with numerically added noise, and similarly show that the method works well for a substantially reduced set of data. For the CS calculations, we use two different bases in which the process matrix 𝜒 is approximately sparse, and show that the resulting estimates of the process matrices match each other with reasonably high fidelity. For both two-qubit and three-qubit gates, we characterize the quantum process by not only its process matrix and fidelity, but also by the corresponding standard deviation, defined via variation of the state fidelity for different initial states.},

It eliminates the need for optimizing the frequency of the charging laser field whose optimal value in the bare setting depends on the coupling strengths between the charger and the batteries.},

In this article, we identify the optimal pure single-mode Gaussian probe states depending on the knowledge of the estimated phase parameter before the measurement. We find that for a large prior uncertainty, the optimal probe states are close to coherent states, a result in line with findings from noisy parameter estimation. But with increasingly precise estimates of the parameter it becomes beneficial to put more of the available energy into the squeezing of the probe state. Surprisingly, there is a clear jump, where the optimal probe state changes abruptly to a squeezed vacuum state, which maximizes the Fisher information for this estimation task. We use our results to study repeated measurements and compare different methods to adapt the probe state based on the changing knowledge of the parameter according to the previous findings.},

  abstract = {Quantum control allows us to address the problem of engineering quantum dynamics for special purposes. While recently the field of quantum batteries has attracted much attention, optimization of their charging has not benefited from the quantum control methods. Here we fill this gap by using an optimization method. We apply for the first time the convergent iterative method for the control of the population of a bipartite quantum system in two cases, starting with a qubit-qubit case. The quantum charger-battery system is considered here, where the energy is pumped into the charger by an external classical electromagnetic field. Secondly, we systematically extend our investigation to a second case involving two harmonic oscillators in the Gaussian regime, presenting an original formulation of the method. In both cases, the charger is considered to be an open dissipative system, as its interaction with the drive may require a more pronounced exposure to general interaction with environment. A key consideration in our optimization strategy is the practical concern of turning the charging external field on and off. We find that optimizing the pulse shape yields a substantial enhancement in both the power and efficiency of the charging process compared to a sinusoidal drive. The harmonic oscillator configuration of quantum batteries is particularly intriguing, as the optimal driving pulse remains effective regardless of the environmental temperature. This study introduces a novel approach to quantum battery charging optimization, opening avenues for enhanced performance in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are required are strategies to ‘make rare events typical’ so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

As a first step toward this goal we simulate the thermal relaxation of quantum beats in radical ion pairs (RPs) on a quantum computer as a proof of concept of the method. We present three methods for implementing the thermal relaxation, one which explicitly applies the relaxation Kraus operators, one which combines results from two separate circuits in a classical post-processing step, and one which relies on leveraging the inherent decoherence of the qubits themselves. We use our methods to simulate two real world systems and find excellent agreement between our results, experimental data, and the theoretical prediction.},

A finely adjustable exchange interaction between two qubits in a circuit QED processor efficiently prepares variational ansatz states in the single-excitation subspace respecting the parity symmetry of the qubit-mapped Hamiltonian. Symmetry verification improves the energy and state estimates by mitigating the effects of qubit relaxation and residual qubit excitation, which violate the symmetry. A full-density-matrix simulation matching the experiment dissects the contribution of these mechanisms from other calibrated error sources. Enforcing positivity of the measured density matrix via scalable convex optimization correlates the energy and state estimate improvements when using symmetry verification, with interesting implications for determining system properties beyond the ground-state energy.},

While standard coherence metrics and characterization protocols such as 𝑇1 and 𝑇2, process tomography, and randomized benchmarking are now ubiquitous, these techniques provide only partial information about the dynamic multiqubit loss channels responsible for processor errors, which can be described more fully by a Lindblad operator in the master equation formalism. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate Lindblad tomography, a hardware-agnostic characterization protocol for tomographically reconstructing the Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators of a quantum noise environment from an ensemble of time-domain measurements. Performing Lindblad tomography on a small superconducting quantum processor, we show that this technique naturally builds on standard process tomography and measurement protocols, characterizes and accounts for state-preparation and measurement errors, and allows one to place bounds on the fit to a Markovian model. Comparing the results of single- and two-qubit measurements on a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate that Lindblad tomography can also be used to identify and quantify sources of crosstalk on quantum processors, such as the presence of always-on qubit-qubit interactions.},

Inspired in this classical algorithm, we define a quantum navigation method providing a unique ranking of the elements of a network. We analyze the convergence of quantum navigation to the stationary rank of networks and show that quantumness decreases the number of navigation steps before convergence. In addition, we show that quantum navigation allows to solve degeneracies found in classical ranks. By implementing the quantum algorithm in real networks, we confirm these improvements and show that quantum coherence unveils new hierarchical features about the global organization of complex systems.},

This paper presents a method that enables us to explicitly implement the quantum circuit for Hamiltonian simulation; the key technique is the explicit gate construction of differential operators contained in the target partial differential equation discretized by the finite difference method. Moreover, we show that the space and time complexities of the constructed circuit are exponentially smaller than those of conventional classical algorithms.

  abstract = {Learning unknown processes affecting a quantum system reveals underlying physical mechanisms and enables suppression, mitigation, and correction of unwanted effects. Describing a general quantum process requires an exponentially large number of parameters. Measuring these parameters, when they are encoded in incompatible observables, is constrained by the uncertainty principle and requires exponentially many measurements. However, for Pauli channels, having access to an ideal quantum memory and entangling operations allows encoding parameters in commuting observables, thereby exponentially reducing measurement complexity. In practice, though, quantum memory and entangling operations are always noisy and introduce errors, making the advantage of using noisy quantum memory unclear. To address these challenges we introduce error-mitigated entanglement-enhanced learning and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that even with noise, there is a separation in efficiency between learning Pauli channels with and without entanglement with noisy quantum memory. We demonstrate our protocol's efficacy in examples including hypothesis testing with up to 64 qubits and learning inherent noise processes in a layer of parallel gates using up to 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor. Our protocol provides accurate and practical information about the process, with an overhead factor of \$1.33 \textbackslash pm 0.05\$ per qubit, much smaller than the fundamental lower bound of 2 without entanglement with quantum memory. Our study demonstrates that entanglement with auxiliary noisy quantum memory combined with error mitigation considerably enhances the learning of quantum processes.},

Optimized online strategies involve local, possibly adaptive measurements on each copy and are optimal at each step, which makes them robust in front of particle losses or an abrupt termination of the discrimination process. We first review previous results on binary minimum and zero error discrimination with local measurements that achieve the maximum success probability set by optimizing over global measurements, highlighting their online features. We then extend these results to the case of zero error identification of three symmetric states with constant overlap. We provide optimal online schemes that attain global performance for any \$n\$ if the state overlaps are positive, and for odd \$n\$ if overlaps have a negative value. For arbitrary complex overlaps, we show compelling evidence that online schemes fail to reach optimal global performance. The online schemes that we describe only require to store the last outcome obtained in a classical memory, and adaptiveness of the measurements reduce to at most two changes, regardless of the value of \$n\$.},

Here we take the problem of detecting sudden changes to the quantum domain. We consider a source that emits quantum particles in a default state, until a point where a mutation occurs that causes the source to switch to another state. The problem is then to find out where the change occurred. We determine the maximum probability of correctly identifying the change point, allowing for collective measurements on the whole sequence of particles emitted by the source. Then, we devise online strategies where the particles are measured individually and an answer is provided as soon as a new particle is received. We show that these online strategies substantially underperform the optimal quantum measurement, indicating that quantum sudden changes, although happening locally, are better detected globally.},

This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known, but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement, performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal. By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly relevant in the operating regime of low-energy signals.},

Our protocol is universal and able to automatically sort the input under minimal assumptions, yet partially preserves information contained in the states. We quantify analytically its performance for an arbitrary size and dimension of the data. We contrast it with the performance of its classical counterpart, which clusters data that have been sampled from two unknown probability distributions. We find that the quantum protocol fully exploits the dimensionality of the quantum data to achieve a much higher performance, provided the data are at least three dimensional.

In this paper, we present a landscaping study with a gathered dataset of 441 companies from 42 countries that we identify as quantum start-ups, meaning that they mainly focus on quantum technologies (QT) as their primary priority business. We answer the following questions: (1) What are the temporal and geographical distributions of the quantum start-ups? (2) How can we categorize them, and how are these categories populated? (3) Are there any patterns that we can derive from empirical data on trends? We found that more than 92\% of these companies have been founded within the last 10 years, and more than 50\% of them are located in the US, the UK, and Canada. We categorized the QT start-ups into six fields: (i) complementary technologies, (ii) quantum computing (hardware), (iii) quantum computing (software/application/simulation), (iv) quantum cryptography/communication, (v) quantum sensing and metrology, and (vi) supporting companies, and analyzed the population of each field both for countries, and temporally. Finally, we argue that low levels of quantum start-up activity in a country might be an indicator of a national initiative to be adopted afterwards, which later sees both an increase in the number of start-ups, and a diversification of activity in different QT fields.},

In particular, for DQS of such systems, regular dynamics of the kicked top ensures convergence of the Trotterized time evolution, while chaos in the top, which sets in above a sharp threshold value of the Trotter step size, corresponds to the proliferation of Trotter errors. We show the possibility to analyze this phenomenology in a wide variety of experimental realizations of the kicked top, ranging from single atomic spins to trapped-ion quantum simulators which implement DQS of all-to-all interacting spin-1/2 systems. These platforms thus enable in-depth studies of Trotter errors and their relation to signatures of quantum chaos, including the growth of out-of-time-ordered correlators.},

In the FMO complex, these functional subsystems support multiple quantum pathways for efficient energy transfer that provide a built-in quantum redundancy. There are many instances of redundancy in nature, providing reliability and protection, and in photosynthetic light harvesting this quantum redundancy provides protection against the temporary or permanent loss of one or more chromophores. The complete characterization of functional subsystems within the FMO complex offers a detailed map of the energy flow within the FMO complex, which has potential applications to the design of more efficient photovoltaic devices.},

I will demonstrate how one can exploit symmetry to construct realistic codes for transmitting both classical and quantum information down noisy channels, protocols for compressing and copying quantum circuits, as well as metrological schemes for imaging and time-keeping that operate at the quantum mechanical limit.

  abstract = {Over a century has past since the discovery of quantum mechanics and whilst scientists, philosophers—and nowadays youtubers—still argue about the interpretation and philosophical underpinnings of the theory, an entirely new and promising technology exploiting quantum phenomena is starting to emerge.  Over the coming years (and even decades) we are expected to witness a “technological revolution” that promises to transform our everyday lives:  everything from our  computing capabilities to drug design, imaging, and energy harvesting.  In this talk we will take a small tour de force on quantum technologies, outlining what they are (and what they are not) and what they can and cannot do.  In doing so, I hope to provide you with a clear and honest view of the potential of quantum technology, its prospects over the next coming years (particularly here in Spain), its the main goals and challenges, as well as the current research efforts in the Quantum Computing and Thermodynamics group at the University of Granada.

In the case where the devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a global quantum measurement. We also put forth several local measurement strategies—both adaptive and nonadaptive—that achieve the same optimal probability of success in the limit where the number of devices to be checked is large. In the case where the faulty device performs a known unitary operation, we show that the use of entangled probes provides an improvement that even allows perfect identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known qubit channel, we find that the optimal probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels, optimal identification requires entanglement with 𝑁 qubit ancillas.},

  abstract = {In the light of the progress in quantum technologies, the task of verifying the correct functioning of processes and obtaining accurate tomographic information about quantum states becomes increasingly important. Compressed sensing, a machinery derived from the theory of signal processing, has emerged as a feasible tool to perform robust and significantly more resource-economical quantum state tomography for intermediate-sized quantum systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of compressed sensing tomography in the regime in which tomographically complete data is available with reliable statistics from experimental observations of a multi-mode photonic architecture. Due to the fact that the data is known with high statistical significance, we are in a position to systematically explore the quality of reconstruction depending on the number of employed measurement settings, randomly selected from the complete set of data, and on different model assumptions. We present and test a complete prescription to perform efficient compressed sensing and are able to reliably use notions of model selection and cross validation to account for experimental imperfections and finite counting statistics. Thus, we establish compressed sensing as an effective tool for quantum state tomography, specifically suited for photonic systems.},

In this work, we establish a new link between concepts of quantum information theory and condensed matter physics by presenting a unified understanding of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order protected by subsystem symmetries and its relation to measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). The key unifying ingredient is the concept of quantum cellular automata (QCA) which we use to define subsystem symmetries acting on rigid lower-dimensional lines or fractals on a 2D lattice. Notably, both types of symmetries are treated equivalently in our framework. We show that states within a non-trivial SPT phase protected by these symmetries are indicated by the presence of the same QCA in a tensor network representation of the state, thereby characterizing the structure of entanglement that is uniformly present throughout these phases. By also formulating schemes of MBQC based on these QCA, we are able to prove that most of the phases we construct are computationally universal phases of matter, in which every state is a resource for universal MBQC. Interestingly, our approach allows us to construct computational phases which have practical advantages over previous examples, including a computational speedup. The significance of the approach stems from constructing novel computationally universal phases of matter and showcasing the power of tensor networks and quantum information theory in classifying subsystem SPT order.},

  abstract = {The quantum open-system simulation is an important category of quantum simulation. By simulating the thermalization process at zero temperature, we can solve the ground-state problem of quantum systems. To realize the open-system evolution on the quantum computer, we need to encode the environment using qubits. However, usually the environment is much larger than the system, i.e., numerous qubits are required if the environment is directly encoded. In this paper, we propose a way to simulate open-system dynamics by reproducing reservoir correlation functions using a minimized Hilbert space. In this way, we only need a small number of qubits to represent the environment. To simulate the nth−order expansion of the time-convolutionless master equation by reproducing up to n-time correlation functions, the number of qubits representing the environment is ∼⌊n2⌋log2(NωNβ). Here, Nω is the number of frequencies in the discretized environment spectrum, and Nβ is the number of terms in the system-environment interaction. By reproducing two-time correlation functions, i.e., taking n=2, we can simulate the Markovian quantum master equation. In our algorithm, the environment on the quantum computer could be even smaller than the system.},

In particular, for quantum systems of dimension d, we explicitly construct a universal set of semigroup generators, parametrized by d2−3 continuous parameters, and prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for the dynamical simulation of a d-dimensional Markovian quantum system is the ability to implement (a) quantum channels from the semigroups generated by elements of the universal set of generators, and (b) unitary operations on the system. Furthermore, we provide an explicit algorithm for simulating the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system using this universal set of generators, and show that it is efficient, with respect to this universal set, when the number of distinct Lindblad operators (representing physical dissipation processes) scales polynomially with respect to the number of subsystems.},

The present Review aims at giving a comprehensive outlook on the state-of-the-art capabilities offered from these near-term noisy devices as universal quantum simulators, that is, programmable quantum computers potentially able to calculate the time evolution of many physical models. First, a pedagogic overview on the basic theoretical background pertaining digital quantum simulations is given, with a focus on hardware-dependent mapping of spin-type Hamiltonians into the corresponding quantum circuit as a key initial step toward simulating more complex models. Then, the main experimental achievements obtained in the last decade are reviewed, focusing on the digital quantum simulation of such spin models by employing two leading quantum architectures. Their performances are compared, and future challenges are outlined, also in view of prospective hybrid technologies, towards the ultimate goal of reaching the long-sought quantum advantage for the simulation of complex many-body models in the physical sciences.},

In addition, we perform fidelity benchmarking based on this measurement set without explicitly carrying out state tomography. The networks are trained to recognize the fidelity and a reliable measure for informational completeness. By gradually accumulating measurements and data, these trained convolutional networks can efficiently establish a compressive quantum-state characterization scheme by accelerating runtime computation and greatly reducing systematic drifts in experiments. We confirm the potential of this machine-learning approach by presenting experimental results for both spatial-mode and multiphoton systems of large dimensions. These predictions are further shown to improve when the networks are trained with additional bootstrapped training sets from real experimental data. Using a realistic beam-profile displacement error model for Hermite–Gaussian sources, we further demonstrate numerically that the orders-of-magnitude reduction in certification time with trained networks greatly increases the computation yield of a large-scale quantum processor using these sources, before state fidelity deteriorates significantly.},

Two main features of this scheme are the certification protocol that verifies whether the accumulated data uniquely characterize the quantum process and a compressive reconstruction method for the output states. We emulate multipartite scenarios with high-order transverse modes and optical fibers to demonstrate that, in terms of measurement resources, our assumption-free compressive strategy can reconstruct quantum processes almost equally efficiently using all types of input states and basis measurements.},

  abstract = {Spin dynamics in radical pairs showing quantum beats and with nontrivial nuclear interactions are simulated on a quantum computer. Leveraging the inherent qubit noise provides a remarkable match to paramagnetic relaxation in real lab experiments.           ,                             Quantum dynamics of the radical pair mechanism is a major driving force in quantum biology, materials science, and spin chemistry. The rich quantum physical underpinnings of the mechanism are determined by a coherent oscillation (quantum beats) between the singlet and triplet spin states and their interactions with the environment, which is challenging to experimentally explore and computationally simulate. In this work, we take advantage of quantum computers to simulate the Hamiltonian evolution and thermal relaxation of two radical pair systems undergoing the quantum beats phenomenon. We study radical pair systems with nontrivial hyperfine coupling interactions, namely, 9,10-octalin               +               /               p               -terphenyl-               d               14               (PTP)               −               and 2,3-dimethylbutane (DMB)               +               /               p               -terphenyl-               d               14               (PTP)               −               with one and two groups of magnetically equivalent nuclei, respectively. Thermal relaxation dynamics in these systems are simulated using three methods: Kraus channel representations, noise models on Qiskit Aer and the inherent qubit noise present on the near-term quantum hardware. By leveraging the inherent qubit noise, we are able to simulate the noisy quantum beats in the two radical pair systems better than with any classical approximation or quantum simulator.

In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient–doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.},

  abstract = {The impressive pace of advance of quantum technology calls for robust and scalable techniques for the characterization and validation of quantum hardware. Quantum process tomography, the reconstruction of an unknown quantum channel from measurement data, remains the quintessential primitive to completely characterize quantum devices. However, due to the exponential scaling of the required data and classical post-processing, its range of applicability is typically restricted to one- and two-qubit gates. Here, we present a technique for performing quantum process tomography that addresses these issues by combining a tensor network representation of the channel with a data-driven optimization inspired by unsupervised machine learning. We demonstrate our technique through synthetically generated data for ideal one- and two-dimensional random quantum circuits of up to 10 qubits, and a noisy 5-qubit circuit, reaching process fidelities above 0.99 using several orders of magnitude fewer (single-qubit) measurement shots than traditional tomographic techniques. Our results go far beyond state-of-the-art, providing a practical and timely tool for benchmarking quantum circuits in current and near-term quantum computers.},

The system is a network of N qubits oscillating at a given Ømega frequency and which are coupled via Lindblad jump operators built with local fields h\_i depending on some given stored patterns. Our simulations show the emergence of pattern-antipattern oscillations of the overlaps with the stored patterns similar (for large Ømega and small temperature) to those reported within a recent mean-field description of such a system, and which are originated deterministically by the quantum term including s\_x\textasciicircum i qubit operators. However, in simulations we observe that such oscillations are stochastic due to the interplay between noise and the inherent metastability of the pattern attractors induced by quantum oscillations, and then are damped in finite systems when one averages over many quantum trajectories. In addition, we report the system behavior for large number of stored patterns at the lowest temperature we can reach in simulations (namely T=0.005\textbackslash, T\_C). Our study reveals that for small-size systems the quantum term of the Hamiltonian has a negative effect on storage capacity, decreasing the overlap with the starting memory pattern for increased values of Ømega and number of stored patterns. However, it also impedes the system to be trapped for long time in mixtures and spin-glass states. Interestingly, the system also presents a range of Ømega values for which, although the initial pattern is destabilized due to quantum oscillations, other patterns can be retrieved and remain stable even for many stored patterns, implying a quantum-dependent nonlinear relationship between the recall process and the number of stored patterns.},

  abstract = {Transport phenomena are ubiquitous throughout the science, engineering, and technology disciplines as it concerns energy, mass, charge, and information exchange between systems. In particular, energy transport in the nanoscale regime has attracted significant attention within the physical science community due to its potential to explain complex phenomena like the electronic energy transfer in molecular crystals or the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)/light harvesting complexes in photosynthetic bacteria with long time coherences. Energy transport in these systems is highly affected by environmental noise but surprisingly not always in a detrimental way. It was recently found that situations exist where noise actually enhances the transport phenomena. Such noise can take many forms, but can be characterised in three basic behaviors: quantum, correlation in time, or space. All have been shown potential to offer an energy transport enhancement. The focus of this work is on quantum transport caused by stochastic environment with spatio-temporal correlation. We consider a multi-site nearest neighbor interaction model with pure dephasing environmental noise with spatio-temporal correlation and show how an accelerated rate for the energy transfer results especially under negative spatial correlation (anti-correlation). Spatial anti-correlation provides another control parameter to help one establish the most efficient transfer of energy and may provide new insights into the working of exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes. Further the usage of spatio-temporal correlated noise may be a beneficial resource for efficient transport in large scale quantum networks.},

Yet, many of these fairness-aware approaches aim to obtain a unique solution to the problem, which leads to a poor understanding of the statistical limits of bias mitigation interventions. In this study, a novel methodology is presented to explore the tradeoff in terms of a Pareto front between accuracy and fairness. To this end, we propose a multiobjective framework that seeks to optimize both measures. The experimental framework is focused on logistiregression and decision tree classifiers since they are well-known by the machine learning community. We conclude experimentally that our method can optimize classifiers by being fairer with a small cost on the classification accuracy. We believe that our contribution will help stakeholders of sociotechnical systems to assess how far they can go being fair and accurate, thus serving in the support of enhanced decision making where machine learning is used.},

We discuss L\$\textbackslash ell\$QT for the dephasing dynamics of single qubits in detail, which allows for a neat understanding of the importance of including multiple snapshots of the quantum evolution in the likelihood function, and how these need to be distributed in time depending on the noise characteristics. By a detailed comparative study employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, we assess the accuracy and precision of L\$\textbackslash ell\$QT of a dephasing quantum dynamical map that goes beyond the Lindblad limit, focusing on two different microscopic noise models that can be realised in either trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit architectures. We explore the optimization of the distribution of measurement times to minimize the estimation errors, assessing the superiority of each learning scheme conditioned on the degree of non-Markovinity of the noise, and setting the stage for future experimental designs of non-Markovian quantum tomography.},

The framework allows us to propose an efficient QPSQ learner for arbitrary quantum processes accompanied by a provable performance guarantee.

In our new framework, we prove exponential query complexity lower bounds for learning unitary 2-designs, and a doubly exponential lower bound for learning haar-random unitaries.

  abstract = {In the study of open quantum systems, one typically obtains the decoherence dynamics by solving a master equation. The master equation is derived using knowledge of some basic properties of the system, the environment, and their interaction: One basically needs to know the operators through which the system couples to the environment and the spectral density of the environment. For a large system, it could become prohibitively difficult to even write down the appropriate master equation, let alone solve it on a classical computer. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of an open quantum system. On a quantum computer, the environment can be simulated using ancilla qubits with properly chosen single-qubit frequencies and with properly designed coupling to the system qubits. The parameters used in the simulation are easily derived from the parameters of the system + environment Hamiltonian. The algorithm is designed to simulate Markovian dynamics, but it can also be used to simulate non-Markovian dynamics provided that this dynamics can be obtained by embedding the system of interest into a larger system that obeys Markovian dynamics. We estimate the resource requirements for the algorithm. In particular, we show that for sufficiently slow decoherence a single ancilla qubit could be sufficient to represent the entire environment, in principle.},

  abstract = {We present a quantum algorithm based on the Generalized Quantum Master Equation (GQME) approach to simulate open quantum system dynamics on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This approach overcomes the limitations of the Lindblad equation, which assumes weak system-bath coupling and Markovity, by providing a rigorous derivation of the equations of motion for any subset of elements of the reduced density matrix. The memory kernel resulting from the effect of the remaining degrees of freedom is used as input to calculate the corresponding non-unitary propagator. We demonstrate how the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem can be employed to transform the non-unitary propagator into a unitary one in a higher-dimensional Hilbert space, which can then be implemented on quantum circuits of NISQ computers. We validate our quantum algorithm as applied to the spin-boson benchmark model by analyzing the impact of the quantum circuit depth on the accuracy of the results when the subset is limited to the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix. Our findings demonstrate that our approach yields reliable results on NISQ IBM computers.},

This trajectory is expected to continue in building the next generation of devices—ones that can surpass classical computers for particular tasks—but progress in characterization must keep up with the complexities of intricate device noise. A missing piece in the zoo of characterization procedures is tomography, which can completely describe non-Markovian dynamics over a given time frame. Here, we formally introduce a generalization of quantum process tomography, which we call process tensor tomography. We detail the experimental requirements, construct the necessary postprocessing algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation, outline the best-practice aspects for accurate results, and make the procedure efficient for low-memory processes. The characterization is a pathway to diagnostics and informed control of correlated noise. As an example application of the hardware-agnostic technique, we show how its predictive control can be used to substantially improve multitime circuit fidelities on superconducting quantum devices. Our methods could form the core for carefully developed software that may help hardware consistently pass the fault-tolerant noise threshold.},

For any pair of states (pure or mixed) on the Hilbert space of the system, we explicitly show how to construct a Kraus map that transforms one state into another. Moreover, we prove by construction the existence of a Kraus map that transforms all initial states into a predefined target state (such a process may be used, for example, in quantum information dilution). Thus, in sharp contrast to unitary control, Kraus-map dynamics allows for the design of controls which are robust to variations in the initial state of the system. The capabilities of non-unitary control for population transfer between pure states illustrated for an example of a two-level system by constructing a family of non-unitary Kraus maps to transform one pure state into another. The problem of dynamic state controllability of open quantum systems (i.e., controllability of state-to-state transformations, given a set of available dynamical resources such as coherent controls, incoherent interactions with the environment, and measurements) is also discussed.},

Interestingly, with character randomized benchmarking, the two-qubit gate fidelity can be obtained by studying the additional decay induced by interleaving the two-qubit gate in a reference sequence of single-qubit gates only.

Here we explicitly construct an unprecedentedly broader family of supervised learning tasks with classical data to offer the provable advantage of QML based on general quantum computational advantages, progressing beyond Shor's algorithms. Our learning task is feasibly achievable by executing a general class of functions that can be computed efficiently in polynomial time for a large fraction of inputs by arbitrary quantum algorithms but not by any classical algorithm. We prove the hardness of achieving this learning task for any possible polynomial-time classical learning method.
